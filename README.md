# Credit-Score-Classification-using-Random-Forest

Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It instantly helps banks and credit card companies extend loans to customers with good credit ratings. Today, banks and credit card companies use machine learning algorithms to categorize all customers in their databases based on their credit history. So, if you want to learn how to use machine learning for credit scoring, this article is for you. In this article, I'll take you through a machine learning credit rating task using Python.

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

Good
Standard
Poor

People with good credit can get credit from any bank or financial institution. For the credit score classification task, we need a labeled dataset with credit scores.

I've found an ideal dataset for this task, labeled according to the credit history of credit card customers.

I'll take you through the random forest model credit rating task in Python.
